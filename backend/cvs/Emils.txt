As a teenager I developed interest in web technologies, I learned to create websites with HTML, CSS,
PHP and MySQL. Later on, I had to leave my hobby, but the passion was still there, so I returned to
coding, and it has been the right decision, because every day I work with pure pleasure.
I started working professionally as a Javascript developer, mainly frontend, developed my skills with
Javascript, jQuery, later started experimenting with different frontend frameworks, like Angular, React,
Vue. Currently actively working with Node JS and React, MySQL and MongoDB, and playing around with
Go, Event Sourcing, CQRS, Messaging Queues.
