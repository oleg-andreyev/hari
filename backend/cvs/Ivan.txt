About me
I am working with Java since 2012 and still like that. For these years, I gained a lot of different experience in
different roles and projects. There were projects where I was the only one memeber responsible for establishing
new integration with client and where I was working in distributed team. In my work I am focusing on delivering
efficient solution for the business needs, taking into account long term strategy and urgency. Right now, I am
looking for challenging work where I can apply my existing experience and notice the result of my work.
